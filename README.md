# Simple Python Apps Collection

Welcome to the Simple Python Apps Collection! This repository contains a variety of simple Python applications developed by AbdulRahman. These apps are designed to help you learn and practice Python programming concepts in a practical way.

## Apps Included:

1. **Guessing Game:** A classic guessing game where the program selects a secret number and the player tries to guess it.

2. **ShapeAreaCalculator:** Includes classes to calculate the area of rectangles and squares. Demonstrates the use of inheritance in Python.

3. **Prime number:** This app determines whether a given number is a prime number or not. It checks if the number is divisible only by 1 and itself.

4. **RectCalc:** RectCalc is a rectangle calculator that calculates the area of a rectangle based on its length and width.

5. **Factorial calculator:** calculate the factorial of a number.

6. **FruitToColor:** FruitToColor is a dictionary app that maps different colors to their corresponding fruits. Users can look up a color to find out which fruits are associated with it.

7. **Watch your speed** This app is a speed tracker that helps users monitor their driving speed. It provides warnings if the speed exceeds a specified limit and calculates the number of demerit points based on the speed violation.


## Usage:

To use any of the apps, simply run the corresponding Python file.

Example:

```bash
python guessing_game.py
```

Replace 'guessing_game.py' with the filename of the Python file for the app you want to run.
